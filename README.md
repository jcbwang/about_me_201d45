# about_me_201d45

The objective of this guessing game is to answer the questions as close to how I would answer them. Based on the response, a percentage is calculated to determine how compatible the user is to me.

Aliya's code review during class inspired me to implement using boolenas to check if answers were valid. I used these booleans on questions 1-6. https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-201d45/blob/master/class-04-links-functions-css_layout/code-review/201-week1-about-me/js/app.js (Question number 4).

Jackie and Ed have helped me with my code by giving me suggestions on question number 8 (asking about the countries).
